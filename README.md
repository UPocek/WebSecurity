## Learning best practices

Purpose of this project was to introduce us in some basic websecurity concepts as criptography, certificates, https and other secure protocols. Our goal was to create app that manages certificates for other users, like B2C SaaS where people can come generate digital certificates that they need for signing or other confirmation purposes and we will do everything for them in one place.
